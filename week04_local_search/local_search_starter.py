AINL3001 — Knowledge-Driven AI
Week 4 — Local Search and Optimisation
BSP 2026

This week introduces local search.

In previous weeks, search algorithms explored paths through
a state space in order to reach a goal.

Local search takes a different approach:

    1. Start with a state.
    2. Evaluate how good that state is.
    3. Generate neighbouring states.
    4. Move to a better neighbour.
    5. Repeat.

We will explore this using the N-Queens problem.

Tasks
-----

1. Understand the problem representation.
2. Implement conflict counting.
3. Explore neighbouring states.
4. Implement Hill Climbing.
5. Implement Simulated Annealing.
